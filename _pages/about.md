Hi, I'm Thomas Pequegnot — a data-driven problem solver with a passion for building scalable systems that make a real-world impact. I'm currently pursuing a dual degree in Data Science and Computer Science at NYU, where I combine rigorous academic training with hands-on experience in Machine Learning, DevOps, and workflow orchestration.

🚀 My ambition is to lead cross-functional teams in designing intelligent, automated solutions that push the boundaries of what's possible in AI, data engineering, and ethical tech innovation. Whether it's deploying containerized ML pipelines with Kubernetes, optimizing query performance with Apache Iceberg, or crafting real-time analytics dashboards — I thrive at the intersection of strategy and execution.

🧠 I’m fluent in Python, SQL, Java, and C++, and I love working with tools like PyTorch, Pandas, Docker, and Streamlit to bring ideas to life. My curiosity drives me to explore everything from essay grading models to motorsports telemetry platforms — always with scalability and impact in mind.

Outside of tech, I’m a huge fan of:
- 🏎️ **Formula 1** 
- 🏀 **Basketball** 
- 🎬 **Movies**
-  🍜 **Food**

Let’s build something that matters — and have fun doing it. 😄
