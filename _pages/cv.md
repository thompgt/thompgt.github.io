## üß™ Projects

### Real-Time Market Data Forecasting  
**Dec 2024 ‚Äì Jan 2025**  
- Designed an object-oriented Market Predictor class, encapsulating the feature engineering , model training, and prediction to facilitate efficient and reusable machine learning pipelines analyzing over 4 million data entries. 
- Employed a LightGBM regressor, incorporating feature scaling and feature importance analysis, with optimized hyperparameters using RandomizedSearchCV, resulting in a 70% improvement in model accuracy over a baseline model.  
-  Implemented techniques such as moving averages, lag feature creation, and handling missing values to enhance performance.
-  Designed and implemented a visual analysis framework, including plots for correlation matrices, feature group sizes, feature correlations with the target, and feature importance, enabling intuitive exploration and understanding of feature relationships.

### Professor Ratings Analysis  
**Nov 2024 ‚Äì Dec 2024**  
-Performed various statistical tests including t-tests, Mann-Whitney U tests, and Levene‚Äôs tests to analyze gender bias, teaching experience, and the impact of online classes on professor ratings.
- Built a logistic regression model to predict the likelihood of a professor receiving a ‚Äùpepper,‚Äù while addressing class imbalances through techniques such as under sampling and resampling. Evaluated model performance using metrics like AUC and ROC.
-Developed a Ridge regression model to predict average professor rating, achieving R2 of 0.8 and a RMSE of 0.372.

### FIFA Player Performance Predictions  
**Apr 2023**  
-  Strategically engineered relevant features to optimize model input, significantly boosting predictive accuracy for player ranking.
